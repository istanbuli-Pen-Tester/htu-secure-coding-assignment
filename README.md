# Secure Coding Summative Assignment – HTU

**Summative secure coding assignment: applied security & quality principles, threat modeling, and security-based testing on a Java app.**

---

## Overview
This project applies key security and quality principles to a Java application that manages patient and doctor information:
- Defined and implemented security principles (confidentiality, integrity)  
- Illustrated quality principles (understandability, least privilege)  
- Created Use Case and Data Flow diagrams  
- Performed threat modeling (identity theft, MITM, DoS)  
- Executed security-based testing: vulnerability assessment & code review  
- Conducted system testing & performance testing

## Files
- `Secure_Coding_Assignment_Report.docx` – detailed write-up with diagrams, threat model, testing analysis  
- `PatientAndDoctorInfo.java` – main application source code  
- `PatientAndDoctorInfoTest.java` – unit tests for core functionality

## Key Learnings
- Implemented password hashing to mitigate MITM threats  
- Built a structured threat model and mapped controls  
- Applied code-review techniques and security-focused test cases  
- Balanced functional & non-functional (performance) requirements
